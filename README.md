## Aid used

I used the [bootstrap 5.3 documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) extensively for styling. Note that some of the colors I used (e.g. #031633) were taken from bootstrap colors via inspect element, since for some reason `--bs-primary-bg-subtle` didn't work (following same example).

I used [HTMX's documentation](https://htmx.org/) to try to learn HTMX.

I had to remind myself how to update data using flask_sqlalchemy, which I found in their documentation [here](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/quickstart/#query-the-data).
