# Flask Todo App

This is my TODO app for PSET 0b of CS178. I used Flask, HTMX and Bootstrap 5 for my implementation.

My writeup is at `writeup.md`. `writeup.pdf` contains a rendered PDF using the `Markdown to PDF` VSCode extension, although if you're here, the `.md` file looks better and may be slightly more up to date in case I forget to update the PDF. The `todo_app_demo.jpg` shows a screenshot of it in action.
